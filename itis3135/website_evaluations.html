                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/"><u>A Good Website</u></a></h3>
                <p>
                    This is the official website of Apple. It has a navbar at the top of the page,
                    as well as the latest products offered by the company. There are a few ads, 
                    but nothing too extreme. There is a UNICEF ad for donations to support families 
                    affected by the war in Ukraine.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Contrast:</i> The color scheme is very consistent throughout this site. The mix of 
                        black and white, as well as the colors of the products make it very visually pleasing 
                        and simplistic at the same time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Repetition:</i> The fonts and different sections are consistent with each other. 
                        The images are similar size and everything is easy to read. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Alignment:</i> The sections are perfectly aligned with each other. There's a white line 
                        that separates all of the sections both vertically and horizontally. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Proximity:</i> Everything is evenly spaced from each other. Margins are consistent, as well 
                        as the sizes of the displayed sections. The site looks very organized and not cluttered at all.
                    </li>

                <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/"><u>A Bad Website</u></a></h3>
                <p>
                    This website is some sort of Norwegian online marketplace that sells vehicles. 
                    There is no sort of organizational structure to the site, and there are TONS of 
                    random links for things for sale on this site. You can translate it to English, 
                    but even with the English translation this site is almost impossible to understand.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Contrast:</i> Color scheme is pretty much everywhere. Nothing on this site truly matches. 
                        Fonts are somewhat similar throughout the site, but the sizes are everywhere. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Repetition:</i> The main repetition throughout the site is the plethora of boxes of sales 
                        that are all over the place. The pictures are all different sizes and borders are very inconsistent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Alignment:</i> Nothing seems to be aligned with each other as a decent website would look. 
                        There is one column of potential sales in the middle of the site, but that's about all the 
                        alignment that exists within this site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Proximity:</i> The whole site is cluttered. Most links have borders and images, while others have neither.
                        The search tool is pretty hard to find among all the clutter and the site doesn't seem to categorize 
                        the different products accordingly.
